# **LECTURE 1: FOUNDATIONS OF INDUSTRIAL-ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY**

***

## **PART 1: WHAT IS INDUSTRIAL-ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY?**

### **1.1 Definition and Core Purpose**

Industrial-Organizational (I/O) Psychology is the scientific study of human behavior in workplace settings and the application of psychological principles to organizational problems. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)

**The Two-Part Name Reflects Two Focus Areas:**

**Industrial Psychology** = Focus on the individual and the job [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)
**Organizational Psychology** = Focus on the organization and its impact on people [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Core Purpose:**
I/O Psychology applies scientific methods to understand and improve:
- Employee effectiveness (performance, productivity)
- Employee well-being (satisfaction, health, engagement)
- Organizational functioning (culture, leadership, change)

### **1.2 The Two Major Divisions**

I/O Psychology is divided into two interconnected areas: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

#### **INDUSTRIAL PSYCHOLOGY (Personnel Psychology)**

**Focus**: The individual in relation to the job [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Core Topics:**
- **Job Analysis**: Identifying job requirements and necessary Knowledge, Skills, and Abilities (KSAs)
- **Recruitment**: Attracting qualified applicants to the organization
- **Selection**: Choosing the best candidates using tests, interviews, and assessments
- **Training & Development**: Building employee competencies and skills
- **Performance Appraisal**: Measuring and evaluating job performance
- **Compensation**: Designing fair and motivating pay systems

**Think of it as**: Matching people to jobs and managing the employee lifecycle

#### **ORGANIZATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY**

**Focus**: The organization and how it affects people [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Core Topics:**
- **Motivation**: Understanding what drives employee effort and persistence
- **Leadership**: Studying effective leadership behaviors and styles
- **Team Dynamics**: Understanding how groups work together
- **Organizational Culture & Climate**: Examining shared values, norms, and perceptions
- **Job Satisfaction**: Identifying sources of fulfillment and dissatisfaction
- **Organizational Development**: Managing organizational change and improvement

**Think of it as**: Understanding and optimizing the psychological environment of work

### **1.3 How I/O Psychology Integrates Multiple Fields**

I/O Psychology synthesizes knowledge from multiple disciplines: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

- **Psychology**: Theories of learning, motivation, personality, cognition
- **Social Psychology**: Group dynamics, attitudes, interpersonal influence
- **Cognitive Psychology**: Decision-making, problem-solving, memory
- **Clinical Psychology**: Stress, well-being, work-life balance
- **Business & Management**: Strategy, HR practices, organizational structure
- **Economics**: Compensation, incentives, labor markets
- **Sociology**: Organizational culture, social structures, inequality

### **1.4 Measuring Success in I/O Psychology**

I/O Psychology defines organizational success broadly, beyond just profit: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Performance Indicators:**
- Productivity (output per employee)
- Performance quality (accuracy, innovation, customer satisfaction)
- Efficiency (resource utilization)

**Employee Indicators:**
- Retention (keeping valuable employees)
- Job satisfaction (employee happiness and fulfillment)
- Engagement (psychological investment in work)
- Well-being (physical and mental health)

**Equity Indicators:**
- Fairness in decisions (hiring, promotion, compensation)
- Legal compliance (avoiding discrimination)
- Diversity and inclusion

**The Key Principle:**
Sustainable organizational success requires both high performance AND healthy, satisfied employees. Exploiting workers for short-term profit is not considered "success" in I/O Psychology. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

## **PART 2: HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF I/O PSYCHOLOGY**

Understanding the history helps you appreciate how the field evolved and why certain topics are emphasized. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)

### **2.1 Timeline of Major Events**

#### **1879: Birth of Scientific Psychology**

**Event**: Wilhelm Wundt establishes the first psychology laboratory in Leipzig, Germany. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)

**Significance**:
- Psychology separated from philosophy
- Human behavior could be studied scientifically using experimental methods
- Established psychology as an empirical science

#### **1917: The Journal of Applied Psychology Founded**

**Event**: Publication of the first journal dedicated to applied psychology. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)

**Significance**:
- Marked the shift from pure theory to practical application
- Psychology could solve real-world problems
- This journal still exists and is a top-tier outlet for I/O research

#### **1914-1918: World War I**

**Event**: U.S. military needed to assign millions of recruits to appropriate roles efficiently. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)

**I/O Psychology's Contribution:**
Psychologists developed standardized tests: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)
- **Army Alpha Test**: Written intelligence test for literate soldiers
- **Army Beta Test**: Non-verbal test for illiterate soldiers or non-English speakers  
- **Personality Assessments**: To identify leadership potential and temperament

**Impact**:
- Demonstrated that psychological measurement could predict real-world outcomes at scale [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)
- Gave I/O Psychology credibility as a practical discipline
- Established testing as a core I/O methodology

#### **1930s: The Hawthorne Studies**

**Event**: Research conducted at Western Electric's Hawthorne plant near Chicago. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)

**Original Research Question**: How do physical working conditions (lighting levels) affect productivity?

**Unexpected Finding**: Productivity increased regardless of whether lighting was increased or decreased. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)

**Explanation - The Hawthorne Effect**: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)
Workers' productivity improved not because of the lighting changes, but because:
- They knew they were being observed
- They received attention from researchers
- They felt valued and important

**Key Insights**: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)
- Employee behavior is influenced by **social and psychological factors**, not just physical/economic conditions
- **Interpersonal interactions** and **work environment** matter for performance
- **Observation changes behavior** (critical methodological consideration)

**Why This Matters:**
The Hawthorne Studies shifted I/O Psychology's focus from purely technical/mechanical views of workers to understanding the human, social, and emotional aspects of work. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)

#### **1960s: The Civil Rights Movement**

**Event**: Civil Rights Act of 1964 made employment discrimination illegal. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)

**Impact on I/O Psychology**:
Organizations needed to justify their hiring, promotion, and compensation practices scientifically. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)

**I/O Psychologists' Role:**
- Demonstrating that selection tools are **job-related** and **valid**
- Identifying **adverse impact** against protected groups (race, gender, age, etc.)
- Designing **fair** and **legally defensible** assessment procedures

**Significance**:
- Established legal and ethical standards for employee selection [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIPaK5ObMpM)
- Made validity evidence a legal requirement
- Elevated the importance of fairness and equity in I/O Psychology

***

## **PART 4: RESEARCH METHODS FUNDAMENTALS**

### **4.1 Why Research Matters in I/O Psychology**

I/O Psychology is a **science**, not common sense or intuition. Every claim about workplace behavior must be supported by empirical evidence. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Problems Without Research:**
Organizations make decisions based on:
- Personal experience ("I've always hired this way")
- Anecdotes ("I once hired someone who...")
- Gut feelings ("They seem like a good fit")
- Management fads ("Everyone is doing this now")

**Consequences of Non-Scientific Approaches:**
- Billions wasted on ineffective training programs
- Selection tools that don't predict performance
- Motivation programs that backfire
- Unintentional discrimination against protected groups

**What Research Provides**: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)
- **Data-driven solutions** that actually work
- **Evidence** to critically evaluate claims
- **Informed decision-making** rather than guesswork
- **Legal defensibility** for HR practices

### **4.2 Core Research Terminology**

#### **Independent Variable (IV)**

**Definition**: The predictor variable that the researcher manipulates or measures. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Also called**: Predictor, treatment variable, factor

**In causal terms**: The "cause" (though correlation ≠ causation in non-experimental designs)

**Examples:**
- Type of training (online vs. in-person)
- Leadership style (transformational vs. transactional)
- Interview structure (structured vs. unstructured)
- Compensation system (fixed salary vs. performance-based)

#### **Dependent Variable (DV)**

**Definition**: The outcome variable that depends on (or is predicted by) the IV. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Also called**: Outcome variable, criterion

**In causal terms**: The "effect"

**Examples:**
- Job performance (supervisor ratings)
- Employee turnover (stayed vs. left)
- Job satisfaction (survey score)
- Productivity (units produced per hour)

**Example Research Study:**
```
Research Question: Does structured interviewing improve selection quality?

Independent Variable (IV):
- Interview type (structured vs. unstructured)

Dependent Variable (DV):
- New hire performance after 6 months
- Measured by: Supervisor ratings on 1-5 scale

Design:
- Half of candidates receive structured interviews
- Half receive unstructured interviews
- Compare performance of hired employees from each group
```

#### **Population**

**Definition**: The **entire group** of interest that you want to understand. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Characteristics:**
- Defined by research question
- Usually impossible to study completely
- Parameters (true values) are unknown

**Examples:**
- All registered nurses in Canada
- All Fortune 500 CEOs
- All employees at Company X
- All software engineers worldwide

#### **Sample**

**Definition**: A **subset** of the population that you actually study. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Purpose**: Use the sample to make **inferences** about the population

**Examples:**
- 300 registered nurses from 5 hospitals in Ontario
- 45 Fortune 500 CEOs who agreed to interviews
- 1,200 employees (out of 5,000 total) at Company X
- 500 software engineers from 10 tech companies

**The Inference Process:**
```
POPULATION                 SAMPLE
(Want to know about)  ←─── (Actually study)
Unknown parameters          Known statistics
                           
Example:
Population: All teachers     Sample: 600 teachers
Parameter: μ = ?            Statistic: M = 3.4
(true mean satisfaction)    (sample mean)

We use M = 3.4 to ESTIMATE μ
```

#### **Parameter**

**Definition**: A numerical value describing a **population**. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Notation**: Greek letters
- μ (mu) = Population mean
- σ (sigma) = Population standard deviation
- ρ (rho) = Population correlation

**Characteristic**: Usually **unknown** (we don't have data on entire population)

**Examples:**
- The true average job satisfaction of all U.S. employees is μ = 3.6
- The true correlation between conscientiousness and performance for all managers is ρ = 0.32

#### **Statistic**

**Definition**: A numerical value describing a **sample**. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Notation**: Roman letters
- M or \(\bar{X}\) = Sample mean
- SD or s = Sample standard deviation  
- r = Sample correlation

**Characteristic**: **Known** (we calculated it from our data)

**Examples:**
- In our sample of 500 employees, mean satisfaction is M = 3.7
- In our sample of 200 managers, correlation between conscientiousness and performance is r = 0.28

**Relationship Between Parameters and Statistics:**
```
Statistic = Estimate of Parameter

Sample Mean (M) → estimates → Population Mean (μ)
Sample SD (s)   → estimates → Population SD (σ)
Sample r        → estimates → Population ρ
```

***

## **PART 5: SAMPLING STRATEGIES**

How you select your sample determines whether your findings generalize beyond the specific people you studied. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

### **5.1 Random Sample**

**Definition**: Every individual in the population has an **equal chance** of being selected. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Procedure:**
1. Obtain a complete list of the population (sampling frame)
2. Assign each person a unique number
3. Use a random number generator to select sample members
4. Contact selected individuals

**Example:**
```
Population: 10,000 employees at a company
Goal: Select 500 for a survey

Process:
1. Obtain employee roster (all 10,000 names)
2. Number employees 1 to 10,000
3. Generate 500 random numbers between 1 and 10,000
4. Invite those 500 employees to participate

Result: Each employee had a 500/10,000 = 5% chance of selection
```

**Advantages:**
- Eliminates selection bias
- Sample is likely representative of population
- Allows use of probability theory for statistical inference
- Findings generalize to population with known confidence

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires complete population list (often unavailable)
- Expensive and time-consuming
- Low response rates (people decline participation)
- Difficult to access selected individuals

**Why It's Rare in I/O Psychology**: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)
Most populations of interest (e.g., "all managers worldwide") don't have accessible, complete lists. Organizations rarely give researchers random access to all employees.

### **5.2 Stratified Random Sample**

**Definition**: Divide the population into meaningful subgroups (strata), then randomly sample within each stratum. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Purpose**: Ensure adequate representation of important subgroups

**Procedure:**
1. Divide population into strata based on a characteristic (gender, department, job level)
2. Determine desired sample size for each stratum (proportional or equal)
3. Randomly sample within each stratum

**Example: Proportional Stratified Sampling**
```
Population: 10,000 employees
- 6,000 men (60%)
- 4,000 women (40%)

Goal: Sample 500 employees with proportional gender representation

Method:
Stratum 1 (Men): Randomly select 300 men (60% of 500)
Stratum 2 (Women): Randomly select 200 women (40% of 500)

Result: Sample matches population proportions exactly
```

**Example: Equal Stratified Sampling**
```
Population: 10,000 employees across 5 departments
- Sales: 3,000 (30%)
- Engineering: 2,500 (25%)
- Operations: 2,000 (20%)
- Customer Service: 1,500 (15%)
- Admin: 1,000 (10%)

Goal: Compare departments (need sufficient sample in each)

Method: Randomly select 100 from EACH department

Result:
- Total sample = 500
- Each department has equal representation (not proportional)
- Allows meaningful statistical comparisons across departments
```

**Advantages:**
- Guarantees representation of important subgroups
- More precise estimates for subgroups
- Can compare subgroups statistically

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires knowing population characteristics in advance
- More complex sampling procedure
- Still requires population lists within each stratum

**When to Use:**
- Comparing subgroups is theoretically important
- Some subgroups are small and might be missed in simple random sampling
- Different variability across strata

### **5.3 Convenience Sample**

**Definition**: Study whoever is **accessible and willing** to participate. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Also Called**: Availability sampling, opportunity sampling

**Procedure:**
1. Identify accessible groups (students, employees at one company, your LinkedIn network)
2. Invite participation
3. Study whoever agrees

**Examples:**
- Psychology students in a university research pool
- Employees at a single company that gave you access
- People who responded to your social media survey post
- Professionals in your personal network
- Attendees at a conference

**Advantages:**
- Quick and inexpensive [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)
- Easy to implement
- No need for population lists
- High practical feasibility

**Disadvantages:**
- **Selection bias**: Volunteers differ systematically from non-volunteers [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)
- **Limited generalizability**: Findings may not extend beyond your specific sample [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)
- **Confounding factors**: Unique sample characteristics may drive results [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)
- Cannot calculate sampling error or confidence intervals accurately

**Example of Selection Bias:**
```
Research Question: What motivates employees to work hard?

Convenience Sample: Post survey link on LinkedIn
"Help me with my research! Take my 20-minute motivation survey"

Who Responds:
- People with free time (less busy employees)
- People who like surveys (different personality)
- People active on LinkedIn (more career-focused)
- People who want to help (more agreeable)

Who Doesn't Respond:
- Busy, high-performing employees (no time)
- Survey-averse people
- People not on LinkedIn (older employees, blue-collar workers)
- Less helpful people

Result: Your sample systematically differs from the population
Findings about "what motivates employees" may be biased
```

**Example of Limited Generalizability:**
```
Study: Predictors of employee turnover

Convenience Sample: Single tech startup in Silicon Valley

Sample Characteristics:
- Tech industry (unique turnover patterns)
- Startup culture (high risk, high reward)
- Silicon Valley location (many nearby opportunities)
- Young company (less established processes)

Findings May NOT Generalize To:
- Manufacturing companies
- Government agencies
- Rural locations
- Established corporations
- Other industries

Conclusion: Results are specific to tech startups, not all organizations
```

**How to Strengthen Convenience Samples:**
- **Describe sample thoroughly**: Report demographics, context, response rate
- **Acknowledge limitations**: Explicitly state generalizability constraints
- **Replicate across samples**: Test findings in multiple convenience samples from different contexts
- **Compare to known population values**: If population data exists, check if your sample is representative

***

## **PART 6: FROM IDEAS TO THEORIES**

Research progresses through stages of increasing formalization. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

### **6.1 Ideas**

**Definition**: Informal observations or questions that spark curiosity. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Characteristics:**
- Based on casual observation or personal experience
- Not grounded in prior research yet
- Broad and exploratory
- No specific predictions

**Examples:**
- "Remote workers seem happier than office workers"
- "I wonder if extraverted people perform better in sales roles"
- "Does employee recognition affect motivation?"
- "Maybe flexible schedules reduce turnover"

**Where Ideas Come From:**
- Personal work experience
- Observations in organizations
- Reading news articles about workplace trends
- Conversations with practitioners
- Gaps in existing research

### **6.2 Hypotheses**

**Definition**: Specific, testable predictions based on prior research and theory. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Requirements for a Good Hypothesis**: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)
1. **Specific**: Clearly identifies variables and relationships
2. **Testable**: Can be supported or refuted with data
3. **Directional** (when theory allows): States positive or negative relationship
4. **Theory-grounded**: Based on existing research, not speculation

**Structure**: "If [theory/prior research], then [predicted relationship between variables]"

**Examples:**

**Weak (Not Really a Hypothesis):**
- "Leadership affects performance"
- "Job satisfaction is related to turnover"
- "Training might help employees"

**Strong (True Hypotheses):**
- "Based on Social Exchange Theory, employees who perceive organizational support will report higher job satisfaction than employees who perceive low support"
- "Hypothesis: Structured interviews will yield higher predictive validity than unstructured interviews (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998)"
- "Following Equity Theory, employees who perceive pay inequity will demonstrate lower organizational commitment and higher turnover intentions compared to employees perceiving pay equity"

**Why These Are Better:**
✓ Name specific variables (organizational support, job satisfaction)
✓ State direction of relationship (higher support → higher satisfaction)
✓ Reference theory or prior research (Social Exchange Theory, Schmidt & Hunter)
✓ Testable (can measure all variables)

### **6.3 Distinguishing Hypotheses from Research Questions**

**Hypothesis**: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)
- Makes a specific prediction
- States expected direction of relationship
- Tests established theory
- Example: "Conscientiousness will positively predict job performance"

**Research Question**: [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)
- Open-ended exploration
- No specific prediction
- Used when theory is underdeveloped or absent
- Example: "What personality traits predict performance in remote work settings?"

**When to Use Each:**

Use **Hypothesis** when:
- Strong theory exists
- Prior research provides clear expectations
- You're confirming/extending known relationships

Use **Research Question** when:
- Exploring new phenomena
- Theory is unclear or conflicting
- Qualitative or exploratory research

### **6.4 Theories**

**Definition**: Systematic sets of widely accepted assumptions that explain **why** phenomena occur, based on cumulative and replicated research. [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kcm-s-xaQDU)

**Characteristics of Strong Theories:**

**1. Explanatory Power**
- Explains the **mechanism** (not just "what" but "why" and "how")
- Provides underlying psychological processes

**2. Empirical Support**
- Supported by multiple studies
- Replicated across different samples and contexts
- Evidence from various research methods

**3. Falsifiable**
- Makes predictions that could be proven wrong
- Can be tested empirically

**4. Generative**
- Leads to new hypotheses
- Stimulates further research
- Has practical applications

**5. Parsimonious**
- Explains phenomena as simply as possible
- Doesn't require unnecessary complexity

**Examples of I/O Psychology Theories:**

**Equity Theory (Adams, 1965)**
- **Core Idea**: People are motivated by fairness; they compare their input/outcome ratio to others
- **Mechanism**: Perceived inequity creates psychological tension, motivating actions to restore equity
- **Predictions**: Underpaid employees will reduce effort; overpaid employees may increase effort
- **Applications**: Compensation design, organizational justice

**Expectancy Theory (Vroom, 1964)**
- **Core Idea**: Motivation = Expectancy × Instrumentality × Valence
- **Mechanism**: People rationally calculate expected value of effort
- **Predictions**: Motivation requires believing effort→performance→valued outcomes
- **Applications**: Incentive system design, goal-setting

**Job Characteristics Model (Hackman & Oldham, 1976)**
- **Core Idea**: Five job dimensions (variety, identity, significance, autonomy, feedback) create psychological states leading to motivation
- **Mechanism**: Meaningful, responsible, knowledge-rich work is intrinsically motivating
- **Predictions**: Jobs high in core dimensions yield higher motivation and satisfaction
- **Applications**: Job redesign, enrichment programs

### **6.5 The Research Cycle**

Research is an iterative process:

```
        ┌─────────────┐
        │   THEORY    │
        └──────┬──────┘
               │
               ↓
        Generate HYPOTHESES
               │
               ↓
        Design STUDY
               │
               ↓
        Collect DATA
               │
               ↓
        Analyze RESULTS
               │
               ↓
        Interpret FINDINGS
               │
               ↓
     Support or Refute Theory
               │
               ↓
        Refine/Extend THEORY
               │
               └───────→ (cycle continues)
```

**How Theories Evolve:**
1. Initial theory proposed (based on observations)
2. Researchers test hypotheses derived from theory
3. Results support some predictions, refute others
4. Theory is refined to account for new findings
5. Refined theory generates new hypotheses
6. Cycle repeats

**Example: Evolution of Motivation Theory**
```
1950s: Maslow's Hierarchy
- Proposed needs-based motivation
- Hypothesis: People progress through need levels

1960s: Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory
- Refined: Satisfaction ≠ opposite of dissatisfaction
- Hypothesis: Different factors cause each

1960s: Expectancy Theory (Vroom)
- Added cognitive element: People calculate expected value
- Hypothesis: Motivation = E × I × V

1970s: Goal-Setting Theory (Locke & Latham)
- Specified: Specific, difficult goals increase motivation
- Hypothesis: Goal characteristics matter

2000s: Self-Determination Theory
- Integrated: Autonomy, competence, relatedness
- Hypothesis: Intrinsic motivation requires all three

Each theory built on, refined, or challenged predecessors
```
