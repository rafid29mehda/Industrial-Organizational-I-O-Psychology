# **LECTURE 5: EMPLOYEE MOTIVATION THEORY, JOB PERFORMANCE, AND JOB SATISFACTION**

***

## **INTRODUCTION: THE PSYCHOLOGY OF WORKPLACE MOTIVATION**

Understanding what motivates employees is central to Industrial-Organizational Psychology. Motivation directly influences job performance, satisfaction, retention, and organizational success.  

**Motivation Defined**: The psychological forces that determine the direction of a person's behavior, their level of effort, and their level of persistence in the face of obstacles.

**Three Key Components:**
1. **Direction**: What employees choose to do (which tasks, goals, behaviors)
2. **Intensity**: How hard employees work (level of effort)
3. **Persistence**: How long employees continue trying (especially when facing difficulties)

**Why Motivation Matters:**
- Motivated employees perform better
- Higher productivity and quality
- Greater innovation and creativity
- Lower turnover and absenteeism
- Higher job satisfaction and engagement
- Positive organizational climate

This lecture covers major motivation theories that explain **why** people work hard and **what** organizations can do to enhance motivation.  

***

## **PART 1: NEED-BASED THEORIES OF MOTIVATION**

Need theories propose that motivation arises from internal needs or deficiencies that humans are driven to satisfy.  

### **1.1 Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs**

**Abraham Maslow (1943)** proposed that human needs are arranged in a hierarchy from basic to advanced.  

**The Five-Level Hierarchy:**

```
                    ▲
                    │
               SELF-
             ACTUALIZATION
            (Reaching full
             potential)
                    │
              ESTEEM NEEDS
           (Recognition, status,
            achievement, respect)
                    │
           BELONGINGNESS NEEDS
          (Love, friendship, social
           connection, teamwork)
                    │
            SAFETY NEEDS
         (Security, stability, health,
          job security, safe workplace)
                    │
          PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS
         (Food, water, shelter, sleep,
          basic survival - salary)
                    │
                    ▼
```

**Key Principles:**

**1. Prepotency (Lower Needs Dominate):**
- Must satisfy lower-level needs before higher-level needs become motivating
- Hungry employee focused on food, not self-actualization
- Employee fearing layoff focused on security, not achievement

**2. Progression:**
- Once a need is satisfied, it no longer motivates
- Motivation shifts to next higher level
- People continually "climb" the hierarchy

**3. Self-Actualization:**
- Highest need: becoming your best self
- Realizing full potential
- Growth, creativity, meaning

**Workplace Application:**

**Physiological Needs:**
- Adequate salary to afford food, housing, basic necessities
- Reasonable work hours (not exhausting)
- Break time for meals and rest

**Safety Needs:**
- Job security (stable employment)
- Safe working conditions (OSHA compliance, protective equipment)
- Health insurance and benefits
- Predictable, fair policies
- Freedom from harassment and threats

**Belongingness Needs:**
- Team-based work
- Social events (company picnics, celebrations)
- Collaborative culture
- Employee resource groups
- Mentorship programs

**Esteem Needs:**
- Recognition and praise
- Promotions and titles
- Performance awards
- Autonomy and responsibility
- Challenging, meaningful work

**Self-Actualization:**
- Opportunities for creativity and innovation
- Professional development
- Stretch assignments
- Meaningful, purposeful work
- Leadership development programs

**Example:**

```
SCENARIO 1: Employee Focused on Safety Needs

Maria is a single mother worried about layoffs at her company.

Current Motivation:
✗ Not motivated by "employee of the month" award (esteem need)
✗ Not interested in "innovation challenge" (self-actualization)
✓ Focused entirely on job security

Management Response:
- Transparent communication about company stability
- Clear performance expectations (how to keep job)
- Severance policies if layoffs occur
→ Address safety concerns BEFORE esteem/achievement motivators work


SCENARIO 2: Employee Ready for Self-Actualization

David has secure job, good salary, strong team relationships, 
and regular recognition.

Current Motivation:
✗ Additional salary increase provides minimal motivation (physiological satisfied)
✗ More team events don't excite him (belongingness satisfied)
✓ Craves meaningful, challenging work that uses full capabilities

Management Response:
- Assign leadership role in strategic initiative
- Provide autonomy to innovate
- Support pursuit of passion projects
→ Self-actualization opportunities are most motivating
```

**Criticisms of Maslow's Theory:**

**1. Lack of Empirical Support:**
- Research doesn't consistently support hierarchy
- Needs don't always follow this order
- People can pursue multiple needs simultaneously

**2. Cultural Bias:**
- Reflects Western, individualistic values
- Collectivist cultures may prioritize belonging over esteem
- Self-actualization less valued in some cultures

**3. Individual Differences:**
- Not everyone progresses through hierarchy
- Some people prioritize esteem over safety
- Artists may prioritize self-actualization despite poverty (physiological unmet)

**4. Oversimplification:**
- Human motivation is more complex
- Needs interact rather than existing in strict hierarchy

**Despite Limitations:**
- Useful framework for thinking about employee needs
- Reminds managers that different employees motivated by different factors
- Highlights that basic needs must be met for higher motivation

### **1.2 ERG Theory (Alderfer)**

**Clayton Alderfer (1969)** revised Maslow's theory to address its limitations.  

**Three Need Categories:**

**E = Existence Needs:**
- Physiological and safety needs (combined)
- Basic material requirements
- Salary, benefits, working conditions

**R = Relatedness Needs:**
- Social connection and relationships
- Corresponds to Maslow's belongingness
- Teamwork, friendships, respect from others

**G = Growth Needs:**
- Personal development and achievement
- Combines Maslow's esteem and self-actualization
- Creativity, challenge, reaching potential

**Key Differences from Maslow:**

**1. Multiple Needs Simultaneously:**
- Can pursue multiple needs at once
- No strict hierarchy
- More realistic

**2. Frustration-Regression:**
- If higher need is frustrated, regress to focus on lower need
- Example: Can't get promotion (growth frustrated) → Focuses on socializing more (relatedness)

**3. More Empirically Supported:**
- Research shows better support than Maslow
- More flexible, accounts for individual differences

**Workplace Implications:**

```
EXAMPLE: Frustration-Regression

Employee seeks promotion (Growth need)
↓
Denied promotion repeatedly
↓
Growth need frustrated
↓
Employee regresses: Now focuses on building stronger workplace 
friendships (Relatedness need)
↓
Becomes more social, less focused on achievement

Manager should recognize:
- Employee redirected motivation due to frustration
- Address growth need frustration (provide development opportunities, 
  clear path to advancement)
- Don't misinterpret increased socializing as lack of ambition
```

### **1.3 Two-Factor Theory (Herzberg)**

**Frederick Herzberg (1959)** proposed that job satisfaction and dissatisfaction are influenced by two distinct sets of factors.  

**The Two Factors:**

**1. Hygiene Factors (Dissatisfiers):**
- Factors whose **absence** causes dissatisfaction
- But presence does **not** create satisfaction (just neutrality)
- Extrinsic to the work itself

**Hygiene Factors Include:**
- Salary and benefits
- Company policies
- Working conditions (physical environment)
- Job security
- Supervisor relationships
- Co-worker relationships

**2. Motivator Factors (Satisfiers):**
- Factors whose **presence** creates satisfaction and motivation
- But absence does **not** create dissatisfaction (just no satisfaction)
- Intrinsic to the work itself

**Motivator Factors Include:**
- Achievement
- Recognition
- The work itself (interesting, challenging)
- Responsibility
- Advancement/growth
- Personal development

**The Key Insight:**

```
TRADITIONAL VIEW (WRONG):
Satisfaction ←──────────────────────────→ Dissatisfaction
             (Single continuum)

HERZBERG'S VIEW (CORRECT):

SATISFACTION:
High Satisfaction ←──────────→ No Satisfaction
                (Motivators)

DISSATISFACTION:
No Dissatisfaction ←──────────→ High Dissatisfaction
                  (Hygiene Factors)

These are TWO SEPARATE DIMENSIONS, not opposite ends of one continuum
```

**Practical Implications:**

**Implication 1: Salary Doesn't Motivate (Long-Term)**

```
SCENARIO: Employee complains about low motivation

MANAGER'S RESPONSE (Wrong): "Let's give them a raise"

RESULT:
- Short-term: Employee pleased (hygiene factor addressed)
- Long-term: Motivation doesn't increase
- Why: Salary is hygiene factor (prevents dissatisfaction but 
  doesn't create satisfaction)

BETTER RESPONSE: "Let's make their work more challenging and 
meaningful" (Motivator)

RESULT:
- Addresses true motivation issue
- Creates lasting satisfaction
- Increases engagement
```

**Implication 2: Must Address BOTH Factors**

```
CASE 1: Good Hygiene, Poor Motivators

Company offers:
✓ Excellent salary
✓ Great benefits
✓ Beautiful office
✓ Job security

But:
✗ Boring, repetitive work
✗ No recognition
✗ No growth opportunities

Result: Employees are NOT dissatisfied, but NOT motivated
        ("Golden handcuffs" - stay for pay but unmotivated)


CASE 2: Poor Hygiene, Good Motivators

Company offers:
✓ Interesting, challenging work
✓ Recognition and praise
✓ Opportunities for growth

But:
✗ Below-market salary
✗ Terrible working conditions
✗ Unpredictable policies

Result: Employees are dissatisfied DESPITE motivating work
        (Will eventually leave)


OPTIMAL: Good Hygiene AND Good Motivators

✓ Competitive compensation (hygiene)
✓ Safe, comfortable environment (hygiene)
✓ Interesting, meaningful work (motivator)
✓ Recognition and growth (motivator)

Result: Employees are satisfied, motivated, and engaged
```

**Criticisms:**

**1. Research Methodology:**
- Original research used flawed method (asked people to recall good/bad experiences)
- People attribute success to self (motivators) and failures to environment (hygiene)
- Confirmation bias

**2. Oversimplification:**
- Some factors can be both hygiene and motivator
- Example: Salary can motivate (recognition, achievement symbol)
- Individual differences ignored

**3. Not Universally Supported:**
- Subsequent research shows mixed results
- Relationship between factors and satisfaction more complex

**Despite Criticisms:**
- Important insight: Removing dissatisfaction ≠ Creating motivation
- Reminds managers to focus on intrinsic work characteristics
- Money isn't the only (or best) motivator

***

## **PART 2: COGNITIVE THEORIES OF MOTIVATION**

Cognitive theories focus on employees' thoughts, beliefs, and expectations.  

### **2.1 Expectancy Theory (Vroom)**

**Victor Vroom (1964)** proposed that motivation depends on three beliefs about the relationship between effort, performance, and outcomes.  

**The Formula:**

\[ \text{Motivation} = \text{Expectancy} \times \text{Instrumentality} \times \text{Valence} \]

**Three Components:**

**1. Expectancy (E): Effort → Performance**

**Definition**: Belief that effort will lead to successful performance

**Question Employee Asks**: "If I try hard, can I actually succeed?"

**Factors Affecting Expectancy:**
- Self-efficacy (confidence in abilities)
- Task difficulty
- Availability of resources and support
- Past experience with similar tasks
- Training and skills

**High Expectancy:**
- "I'm confident that if I work hard, I'll complete this project successfully"
- Result: Willing to exert effort

**Low Expectancy:**
- "Even if I work hard, I probably won't succeed—this is too difficult/unclear"
- Result: Won't try hard (effort seems futile)

**2. Instrumentality (I): Performance → Outcomes**

**Definition**: Belief that successful performance will lead to valued outcomes

**Question Employee Asks**: "If I perform well, will I actually get the reward?"

**Factors Affecting Instrumentality:**
- Trust in management
- Clarity of reward system
- Past experience (have promises been kept?)
- Transparency of performance-reward link

**High Instrumentality:**
- "I know that if I exceed my sales target, I'll get the bonus—they always deliver"
- Result: Motivated to perform

**Low Instrumentality:**
- "Even if I perform well, I doubt I'll get promoted—they never follow through"
- Result: Unmotivated (performance doesn't matter)

**3. Valence (V): Value of Outcomes**

**Definition**: How much the employee values the potential outcomes/rewards

**Question Employee Asks**: "Do I actually want the reward being offered?"

**Valence Range:**
- **Positive valence** (+): Outcome is desirable (bonus, promotion, recognition)
- **Zero valence** (0): Indifferent to outcome
- **Negative valence** (−): Outcome is undesirable (more responsibility without more pay, relocation)

**High Positive Valence:**
- "I really want that promotion—it's my career goal"
- Result: Motivated

**Zero or Negative Valence:**
- "I don't care about 'employee of the month' parking space"
- "I don't want to relocate for that promotion"
- Result: Unmotivated (reward doesn't appeal)

**The Multiplicative Relationship:**

Because components are multiplied, **if any component is zero, motivation is zero**:

```
EXAMPLE 1: All Three High
Expectancy: 0.9 (confident can succeed)
Instrumentality: 0.9 (trust reward will come)
Valence: +0.9 (really want reward)

Motivation = 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 0.73 (HIGH)


EXAMPLE 2: Low Expectancy
Expectancy: 0.2 (doubt can succeed)
Instrumentality: 0.9 (trust reward will come)
Valence: +0.9 (really want reward)

Motivation = 0.2 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 0.16 (LOW)

Problem: Even though reward is valued and promised, employee doesn't 
think they can achieve it → Not motivated


EXAMPLE 3: Low Instrumentality
Expectancy: 0.9 (confident can succeed)
Instrumentality: 0.2 (don't trust management)
Valence: +0.9 (really want reward)

Motivation = 0.9 × 0.2 × 0.9 = 0.16 (LOW)

Problem: Even though employee can succeed and wants reward, doesn't 
believe management will deliver → Not motivated


EXAMPLE 4: Zero Valence
Expectancy: 0.9 (confident can succeed)
Instrumentality: 0.9 (trust reward will come)
Valence: 0 (don't care about reward)

Motivation = 0.9 × 0.9 × 0 = 0 (ZERO MOTIVATION)

Problem: Employee can succeed and trusts management, but doesn't 
want the reward → Not motivated
```

**Practical Applications:**

**To Increase Expectancy:**
- Provide training and resources
- Set realistic, achievable goals
- Offer coaching and support
- Build employee confidence through early successes
- Clarify task requirements

**To Increase Instrumentality:**
- Make performance-reward link transparent
- Deliver on promises consistently
- Publicize rewards when given
- Create formal reward systems (not arbitrary)
- Build trust through consistent follow-through

**To Increase Valence:**
- Ask employees what they value (individualize rewards)
- Offer choice among rewards
- Ensure rewards are meaningful
- Avoid one-size-fits-all approach

**Real-World Example:**

```
SCENARIO: Sales Team Motivation Problem

Company announces: "Top salesperson this quarter wins trip to Hawaii"

Employee A:
- Expectancy: LOW (0.3) - "I'm new, can't compete with veterans"
- Instrumentality: HIGH (0.9) - "Company will definitely give trip"
- Valence: HIGH (+0.9) - "I'd love to go to Hawaii"
→ Motivation = 0.3 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 0.24 (LOW)
→ Problem: Doesn't think they can win

Employee B:
- Expectancy: HIGH (0.9) - "I'm a top performer, can win"
- Instrumentality: LOW (0.3) - "Last time they promised bonus, I didn't get it"
- Valence: HIGH (+0.9) - "I'd love to go to Hawaii"
→ Motivation = 0.9 × 0.3 × 0.9 = 0.24 (LOW)
→ Problem: Doesn't trust management to deliver

Employee C:
- Expectancy: HIGH (0.9) - "I can win this"
- Instrumentality: HIGH (0.9) - "Company delivers on promises"
- Valence: ZERO (0) - "I don't like traveling, have family commitments"
→ Motivation = 0.9 × 0.9 × 0 = 0 (ZERO)
→ Problem: Doesn't value the reward

Employee D:
- Expectancy: HIGH (0.9) - "I can win this"
- Instrumentality: HIGH (0.9) - "Company delivers"
- Valence: HIGH (+0.9) - "Hawaii trip is perfect for me"
→ Motivation = 0.9 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 0.73 (HIGH)
→ Only Employee D is highly motivated!

LESSON: Same incentive motivates different employees differently
Must diagnose WHICH component is low for each employee
```

### **2.2 Equity Theory (Adams)**

**J. Stacy Adams (1963)** proposed that employees are motivated by fairness and compare their inputs and outcomes to others.  

**Core Principle**: People seek fairness in social exchanges

**The Equity Equation:**

Employees compare ratios:

\[ \frac{\text{My Outcomes}}{\text{My Inputs}} \stackrel{?}{=} \frac{\text{Other's Outcomes}}{\text{Other's Inputs}} \]

**Inputs (What Employee Contributes):**
- Effort and hard work
- Time and hours worked
- Education and training
- Experience and seniority
- Skills and expertise
- Creativity and ideas
- Loyalty and commitment

**Outcomes (What Employee Receives):**
- Salary and bonuses
- Benefits
- Recognition and praise
- Promotions and advancement
- Job security
- Status and prestige
- Interesting work

**Three Possible States:**

**1. Equity (Fair):**

\[ \frac{\text{My Outcomes}}{\text{My Inputs}} = \frac{\text{Other's Outcomes}}{\text{Other's Inputs}} \]

- Perception: "This is fair"
- Emotional state: Satisfied, content
- Behavioral response: Maintain current effort

**2. Underpayment Inequity (Unfair to Me):**

\[ \frac{\text{My Outcomes}}{\text{My Inputs}} < \frac{\text{Other's Outcomes}}{\text{Other's Inputs}} \]

- Perception: "I'm being treated unfairly—I'm getting less than I deserve compared to others"
- Emotional state: Anger, resentment, dissatisfaction
- Motivation: Restore equity

**3. Overpayment Inequity (Unfair in My Favor):**

\[ \frac{\text{My Outcomes}}{\text{My Inputs}} > \frac{\text{Other's Outcomes}}{\text{Other's Inputs}} \]

- Perception: "I'm getting more than I deserve compared to others"
- Emotional state: Guilt, discomfort (though often rationalized away)
- Motivation: Restore equity (less strong than underpayment)

**Methods to Restore Equity:**

**When Experiencing Underpayment Inequity:**

**1. Reduce Inputs:**
- Work less hard ("If they won't pay me fairly, I won't work as hard")
- Take longer breaks
- Arrive late, leave early
- Reduce quality of work

**2. Increase Outcomes:**
- Request raise or promotion
- Take company resources (stealing, inflated expense reports)
- Seek recognition and praise

**3. Distort Perceptions (Cognitive):**
- "Actually, my job is easier than theirs, so lower pay is fair"
- "I have less experience, so this makes sense"
- Rationalize to create perceived equity

**4. Change Comparison Other:**
- "I was comparing myself to the wrong person"
- Choose someone with similar outcomes/inputs ratio
- Downward comparison (compare to worse-off person)

**5. Leave the Situation:**
- Quit job (most drastic)
- Transfer to different department
- Remove self from inequitable situation

**Example: Underpayment Inequity**

```
SCENARIO: Two Software Engineers

Engineer A (You):
- Inputs: Bachelor's degree, 3 years experience, consistently high performance
- Outcomes: $75,000 salary, standard benefits

Engineer B (Colleague):
- Inputs: Bachelor's degree, 3 years experience, similar performance
- Outcomes: $85,000 salary, standard benefits

Your Perception:
"We have the same qualifications and performance, but they earn $10K more!
This is unfair!"

Emotional Response: Anger, resentment

Possible Actions to Restore Equity:

Option 1: Reduce Inputs
- Stop working overtime
- Put in minimum effort
- Reduce code quality

Option 2: Increase Outcomes
- Request raise from manager
- Threaten to leave if not addressed

Option 3: Cognitive Distortion
- "Maybe their project is more critical"
- "They probably negotiated better—that's on me"

Option 4: Change Comparison
- Compare to junior engineers making $60K
- "Actually, I'm doing pretty well"

Option 5: Leave
- Apply to other companies
- Leave for higher-paying job
```

**When Experiencing Overpayment Inequity:**

**Response is Weaker** (people good at rationalizing why they deserve more):

**1. Increase Inputs:**
- Work harder to justify higher pay
- Take on additional responsibilities
- "I'll prove I deserve this"

**2. Cognitive Distortion (Most Common):**
- "I do have special skills they don't recognize"
- "I work harder than it appears"
- "I deserve this for past contributions"

**Overpayment inequity is less motivationally potent** because:
- Humans good at justifying favorable outcomes
- Guilt dissipates quickly
- Self-serving bias ("I deserve good things")

**Importance of Comparison Others:**

**Who Employees Compare Themselves To:**

**Internal Comparisons:**
- Colleagues in same department
- Peers with similar jobs
- Others at same level in organization

**External Comparisons:**
- Friends at other companies
- Industry standards and benchmarks
- Online salary data (Glassdoor, Payscale)

**Historical Comparisons:**
- Own past salary/treatment
- "I used to make X, now I make Y"

**Key Point**: Equity perceptions are subjective—not about absolute fairness, but perceived fairness relative to comparison others.

**Practical Implications for Organizations:**

**1. Pay Transparency (Double-Edged Sword):**
- **Advantage**: Reduces suspicions of unfairness
- **Risk**: Makes inequities salient, can create dissatisfaction
- **Best Practice**: Ensure pay is actually fair before making transparent

**2. Communication:**
- Explain basis for pay decisions
- Clarify how inputs (performance, experience) translate to outcomes
- Help employees understand apparent inequities

**3. Fair Procedures:**
- Implement transparent promotion processes
- Consistent reward systems
- Due process for evaluations

**4. Monitor Comparisons:**
- Be aware of who employees compare themselves to
- Address comparisons that seem unfair
- Help employees choose appropriate comparisons

**Example: Managing Equity Perceptions**

```
PROBLEM: Employee discovers colleague earns more

POOR RESPONSE:
Manager: "I can't discuss other employees' compensation."
[Dismissive, provides no information]

Result: Employee feels disrespected, inequity intensifies, likely to 
reduce effort or leave


BETTER RESPONSE:
Manager: "I understand your concern. Let me explain our compensation 
philosophy. Salary is based on three factors: market rates, experience, 
and performance. Your colleague has been here 5 years versus your 2, 
and has specialized certification that commands premium. Your performance 
is excellent, and at your next review in 3 months, we'll discuss raising 
your salary to reflect your contributions. Here's the typical progression 
for someone in your role..."

Result: Employee understands rationale, perceives fairness in process, 
has clear path forward
```

### **2.3 Goal-Setting Theory (Locke & Latham)**

**Edwin Locke & Gary Latham** developed one of the most well-supported theories in I/O psychology.  

**Core Premise**: Specific, challenging goals lead to higher performance than vague or easy goals.  

**Key Findings:**

**1. Specific Goals > Vague Goals**

```
VAGUE GOAL:
"Do your best"
"Work hard"
"Try to improve sales"

SPECIFIC GOAL:
"Increase sales by 15%"
"Process 50 customer orders per day"
"Reduce defect rate to below 2%"

Research Finding: Specific goals lead to higher performance
Why: Clarity on target, can measure progress, know when achieved
```

**2. Difficult Goals > Easy Goals**

```
EASY GOAL:
"Increase sales by 2%" (far below current performance)

DIFFICULT BUT ACHIEVABLE GOAL:
"Increase sales by 20%" (challenging but possible)

IMPOSSIBLE GOAL:
"Increase sales by 500%" (unattainable)

Research Finding: Difficult (but achievable) goals lead to highest 
performance

Why: Challenges stimulate effort and persistence

Caveat: Goals must be ACHIEVABLE—impossible goals demotivate
```

**Characteristics of Effective Goals (SMART Criteria):**

**S = Specific**
- Clearly defined
- No ambiguity about what's expected

**M = Measurable**
- Can track progress quantitatively
- Know when goal is achieved

**A = Achievable / Attainable**
- Challenging but possible
- Not so difficult that it's demoralizing

**R = Relevant**
- Aligned with organizational objectives
- Meaningful to employee

**T = Time-Bound**
- Deadline specified
- Creates urgency

**Example: SMART Goals**

```
POOR GOAL:
"Improve customer service"

Problems:
✗ Vague (what aspect of customer service?)
✗ Not measurable (how to know if improved?)
✗ No timeframe
✗ Not specific enough to guide behavior


SMART GOAL:
"Increase customer satisfaction scores from 3.5 to 4.0 (out of 5) 
by end of Q2 through reducing average response time from 24 hours 
to 12 hours"

✓ Specific: Customer satisfaction scores, response time
✓ Measurable: 3.5 → 4.0, 24 hours → 12 hours
✓ Achievable: Improvement is substantial but feasible
✓ Relevant: Customer service is core business function
✓ Time-Bound: End of Q2
```

**Mechanisms: Why Goals Improve Performance**

**1. Direction:**
- Goals focus attention on relevant activities
- Reduce wasted effort on irrelevant tasks

**2. Energize:**
- Difficult goals require more effort
- People work harder to reach challenging targets

**3. Persistence:**
- Goals promote sustained effort over time
- Encourage perseverance when encountering obstacles

**4. Strategy Development:**
- Goals prompt people to develop plans and strategies
- Encourage creative problem-solving

**Moderators: When Do Goals Work Best?**

**1. Goal Commitment:**
- Must accept and be committed to goal
- If reject goal as unfair or impossible, won't try

**How to Increase Commitment:**
- Involve employees in goal-setting (participation)
- Explain rationale and importance
- Ensure goals are achievable
- Provide necessary resources
- Leadership support and modeling

**2. Feedback:**
- Must receive progress information
- Goals without feedback are ineffective (don't know if on track)

**Goal + Feedback = Optimal Performance**

```
CONDITION 1: Goal but No Feedback
Employee has target but doesn't know current performance
→ Moderate improvement (guessing blindly)

CONDITION 2: Feedback but No Goal
Employee knows current performance but no target
→ Moderate improvement (no clear direction)

CONDITION 3: Goal AND Feedback
Employee has target AND knows current progress
→ Maximum improvement (can adjust behavior strategically)
```

**3. Task Complexity:**
- **Simple tasks**: Goals directly improve performance
- **Complex tasks**: Goals work but may need more time to develop strategies

**4. Self-Efficacy:**
- Confidence in ability to achieve goal
- Low self-efficacy → Less effort, give up easily
- High self-efficacy → Sustained effort, persistence

**Potential Downsides of Goals:**

**1. Narrow Focus:**
- Goals direct attention, which can cause neglect of non-goal areas
- Example: Sales goal → Neglect customer service

**2. Unethical Behavior:**
- Extreme pressure to meet goals can encourage cheating
- Example: Wells Fargo scandal (opened fake accounts to meet targets)

**3. Short-Term Focus:**
- Goals emphasize immediate results
- May sacrifice long-term outcomes

**4. Reduced Intrinsic Motivation:**
- External goals can undermine enjoyment of work
- Turns interesting task into obligation

**5. Reduced Learning:**
- Performance goals discourage experimentation
- Fear of failure prevents trying new approaches

**Best Practices:**

**1. Collaborative Goal-Setting:**
- Involve employees (increases commitment)
- Negotiated, not imposed

**2. Provide Resources:**
- Training, tools, support to achieve goals
- Remove obstacles

**3. Regular Feedback:**
- Frequent progress updates
- Adjust goals if necessary

**4. Balance Multiple Goals:**
- Don't overemphasize one dimension
- Include quality, safety, ethics alongside quantity

**5. Learning vs. Performance Goals:**
- **Performance goal**: "Achieve sales of $100K"
- **Learning goal**: "Master consultative selling techniques"
- Learning goals better for complex, new tasks

***

## **PART 3: JOB PERFORMANCE**

### **3.1 Defining Job Performance**

**Job Performance**: Employee behaviors and outcomes that contribute to organizational goals. 

**Key Point**: Performance is about **what employees DO** (behaviors), not just results.

**Why This Matters:**
- Behaviors are under employee control; results can be influenced by external factors
- Can evaluate performance even when results delayed or uncertain
- Fair to assess what employee can actually control

### **3.2 Campbell's Model of Job Performance**

**John Campbell** identified multiple dimensions of performance:  

**1. Task Performance (Core Technical Performance):**
- Performing core job duties
- Technical proficiency
- Job-specific knowledge and skills

**Example:**
- Teacher: Delivering effective lessons, grading accurately
- Accountant: Preparing financial statements correctly
- Nurse: Administering medications, monitoring patients

**2. Contextual Performance (Citizenship):**
- Behaviors that support organizational, social, and psychological environment
- NOT core job duties but contribute to effectiveness

**Includes:**
- **Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB)**: Helping colleagues, volunteering for extra duties
- **Compliance**: Following rules and procedures
- **Loyalty**: Promoting organization positively

**Example:**
- Helping new employee learn the ropes (not required)
- Volunteering for committee work
- Defending company when others criticize it

**3. Adaptive Performance:**
- Handling change, uncertainty, emergencies
- Learning new skills
- Dealing with unpredictable situations

**Example:**
- Adjusting to new software system
- Handling crisis situation
- Working effectively under novel conditions

**4. Counterproductive Work Behavior (CWB):**
- Negative behaviors that harm organization
- **REDUCES** performance

**Examples:**
- Theft
- Sabotage
- Absenteeism
- Tardiness
- Workplace aggression
- Withholding effort

### **3.3 Determinants of Job Performance**

**Performance Function:**

\[ \text{Performance} = f(\text{Motivation}, \text{Ability}, \text{Opportunity}) \]

**All Three Necessary:**
- High motivation but low ability = Poor performance (can't do it)
- High ability but low motivation = Poor performance (won't do it)
- High ability and motivation but no opportunity = Poor performance (situational constraints)

**Example:**

```
EMPLOYEE A:
- Motivation: HIGH (wants to succeed)
- Ability: LOW (lacks skills)
- Opportunity: HIGH (resources available)
→ Performance: POOR (Can't perform despite motivation)
→ Solution: Training and development

EMPLOYEE B:
- Motivation: LOW (disengaged)
- Ability: HIGH (highly skilled)
- Opportunity: HIGH (resources available)
→ Performance: POOR (Won't perform despite capability)
→ Solution: Address motivation (goals, rewards, job design)

EMPLOYEE C:
- Motivation: HIGH (wants to succeed)
- Ability: HIGH (highly skilled)
- Opportunity: LOW (lacks tools, time, support)
→ Performance: POOR (Situational constraints prevent performance)
→ Solution: Remove barriers, provide resources

EMPLOYEE D:
- Motivation: HIGH
- Ability: HIGH
- Opportunity: HIGH
→ Performance: HIGH (All conditions met)
```

## **PART 4: JOB SATISFACTION**

### **4.1 Definition**

**Job Satisfaction**: An employee's overall evaluation of their job—the extent to which they feel positively or negatively about their work.  

**Attitude Components:**

**1. Cognitive**: Beliefs about the job ("My job is challenging")
**2. Affective**: Feelings about the job ("I enjoy my work")
**3. Behavioral**: Intentions and actions ("I plan to stay here")

### **4.2 Facets of Job Satisfaction**

Job satisfaction is multidimensional:  

**1. Satisfaction with Work Itself:**
- Is the work interesting and meaningful?
- Does it use my skills?
- Is it varied or monotonous?

**2. Satisfaction with Pay:**
- Is compensation adequate?
- Fair compared to others?
- Commensurate with effort?

**3. Satisfaction with Promotion Opportunities:**
- Clear advancement path?
- Fair promotion process?
- Realistic opportunities for growth?

**4. Satisfaction with Supervision:**
- Supportive, competent manager?
- Fair treatment?
- Good communication?

**5. Satisfaction with Co-workers:**
- Collegial relationships?
- Teamwork and cooperation?
- Social support?

**6. Satisfaction with Working Conditions:**
- Safe, comfortable environment?
- Adequate resources?
- Reasonable hours and workload?

**Overall Satisfaction**: Global evaluation across all facets

**Example: Facet Analysis**

```
Employee Job Satisfaction Profile:

Work itself:              4.5/5  (Very satisfied - challenging, meaningful)
Pay:                      2.0/5  (Dissatisfied - below market)
Promotion opportunities:  2.5/5  (Somewhat dissatisfied - unclear path)
Supervision:              5.0/5  (Very satisfied - excellent manager)
Co-workers:               4.0/5  (Satisfied - great team)
Working conditions:       3.5/5  (Neutral - adequate but not great)

OVERALL:                  3.6/5  (Moderately satisfied)

Analysis: Employee has HIGH satisfaction with work content, supervision, 
and colleagues, but LOW satisfaction with pay and advancement. Overall 
satisfaction is moderate. Risk of turnover if pay issue not addressed, 
despite positive aspects.
```

### **4.3 Measuring Job Satisfaction**

**Common Instruments:**

**1. Job Descriptive Index (JDI):**
- Measures facets separately (work, pay, promotion, supervision, co-workers)
- Yes/No/? response format
- Well-validated

**2. Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ):**
- Intrinsic and extrinsic satisfaction
- 5-point Likert scale

**3. Single-Item Measures:**
- "Overall, how satisfied are you with your job?" (1-5 scale)
- Quick but less reliable

### **4.4 Determinants of Job Satisfaction**

**What Causes Job Satisfaction?**

**Situational Factors (Job Characteristics):**

**1. Job Complexity and Challenge:**
- More complex, challenging jobs → Higher satisfaction
- Variety, autonomy, significance increase satisfaction

**2. Fair Pay:**
- Pay level matters
- Pay fairness matters MORE (equity theory)

**3. Advancement Opportunities:**
- Clear career path increases satisfaction
- Blocked mobility decreases satisfaction

**4. Leadership Quality:**
- Supportive, competent supervisors increase satisfaction
- Abusive, incompetent supervisors decrease satisfaction

**5. Co-worker Quality:**
- Positive relationships increase satisfaction
- Conflict decreases satisfaction

**6. Working Conditions:**
- Safe, comfortable environment increases satisfaction
- Dangerous, unpleasant conditions decrease satisfaction

**Individual Factors (Dispositional):**

**1. Personality:**
- **Positive affectivity**: Tendency to experience positive emotions → Higher satisfaction
- **Negative affectivity**: Tendency to experience negative emotions → Lower satisfaction
- **Core self-evaluations**: Self-esteem, self-efficacy, locus of control, emotional stability predict satisfaction

**2. Person-Job Fit:**
- Match between individual and job characteristics
- Better fit → Higher satisfaction

**3. Expectations:**
- Unmet expectations → Dissatisfaction
- Realistic job previews help set accurate expectations

### **4.5 Consequences of Job Satisfaction**

**Does Satisfaction Matter? YES.**

**1. Job Performance:**
- Modest positive correlation (r = .30)
- Satisfied employees perform slightly better
- **Causation unclear**: Does satisfaction cause performance, or does performance cause satisfaction? (Probably both)

**2. Turnover:**
- **Strong negative correlation** (r = -.40 to -.50)
- Dissatisfied employees much more likely to quit
- Satisfaction is one of best predictors of turnover

**Progression to Turnover:**
```
Job Dissatisfaction
↓
Thoughts of quitting
↓
Job search
↓
Evaluate alternatives
↓
Intention to quit
↓
Turnover
```

**3. Absenteeism:**
- Negative correlation (r = -.25)
- Dissatisfied employees miss more work
- Weaker than turnover relationship

**4. Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB):**
- Positive correlation (r = .30)
- Satisfied employees go "above and beyond"
- Help colleagues, volunteer, promote organization

**5. Customer Satisfaction:**
- Satisfied employees provide better service
- Impacts customer experience and loyalty
- Important in service industries

**6. Health and Well-being:**
- Job satisfaction associated with better mental and physical health
- Lower stress, depression, burnout
- Higher life satisfaction

**7. Counterproductive Work Behavior:**
- Dissatisfaction linked to theft, sabotage, aggression
- Retaliation against perceived unfairness

### **4.6 Job Satisfaction-Performance Relationship**

**Three Competing Hypotheses:**

**1. Satisfaction → Performance** (Satisfaction causes performance)
- **Logic**: Happy workers are productive workers
- **Evidence**: Weak support; correlation modest

**2. Performance → Satisfaction** (Performance causes satisfaction)
- **Logic**: Good performance leads to rewards → Satisfaction
- **Evidence**: Stronger support; mediated by rewards

**3. Reciprocal / Spurious**
- **Logic**: Both influenced by third variables (personality, job characteristics)
- **Evidence**: Best supported; complex relationship

**Conclusion**: Relationship exists but is complex and modest. Other factors (ability, motivation, job design) matter more for performance.

# **CONCLUSION: INTEGRATING MOTIVATION, PERFORMANCE, AND SATISFACTION**

**Key Takeaways:**

**1. Motivation Theories Complement Each Other:**
- Need theories: What do employees need?
- Cognitive theories: How do employees think about work?
- Different theories useful for different situations

**2. Multiple Paths to Motivation:**
- Job design (interesting work)
- Goal-setting (clear targets)
- Fair treatment (equity)
- Valued rewards (expectancy)
- Meeting needs (hierarchy)

**3. Performance Is Multidimensional:**
- Task performance (doing the job)
- Contextual performance (citizenship)
- Adaptive performance (flexibility)
- Avoid counterproductive behaviors

**4. Satisfaction Matters:**
- Affects retention, citizenship, well-being
- But isn't sole driver of performance
- Must address both satisfaction and performance drivers

**5. Systems Perspective:**
- Motivation, performance, and satisfaction interconnected
- Changes in one affect others
- Holistic approach necessary for organizational effectiveness
